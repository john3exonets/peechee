# Peechee
Just like that old orange Peechee you had in school, this program is built to 'bind' together 
files from various applications, mail messages, etc. into one 'clip' so that related information
is kept together.

## OSX Only
Sorry Window users, but this program is designed to run on Mac OS X only at the moment.  I 
tried to keep the file launching code such that it could be swapped out for other Operating
Systems, so if someone wants to try that for Windows, feel free to branch.
